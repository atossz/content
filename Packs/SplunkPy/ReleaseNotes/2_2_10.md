#### Integrations
##### SplunkPy
- This integration version is now aligned to the SplunkPyPreRelease version 1.0.4 which introduced significant change on the fetch mechanism.
- Added **Fetch backwards window** parameter to define the minimum time range to fetch. 
- Added **Unique ID fields** parameter to define a list of fields the integration will consider when looking for duplicate events.
