##### New: Wait And Complete Task By Status
- Waits for a task to reach a certain status, and allows to complete the task. The playbook should be used in a loop until the FoundTaskNames context key contains the name of the awaited task (the playbook outputs that name). (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.0.0).
