#### Playbooks
##### New: Checkpoint - Block IP - Append Group
- This playbook will use an object group in order to block IPs.
The playbook receives malicious IP addresses as inputs, checks if the object group exists (and if not will create one), and will append the related IPs in that object.
Please remember to assign the appended group to a rule in your FW policy.
